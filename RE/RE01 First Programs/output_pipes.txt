The Linux terminal provides pipes that can be used, among other things, to redirect the output of a command to a file.

For example, try to do:

echo "hi"
echo "hi" > f

What was the difference?

Now, go to your desktop directory using cd and create a directory called ex5 for this exercise using mkdir.

Inside the new directory, using the previous commands, write "Hello" into a file called file1 and "Bye" into file2. Note that file extensions are not required in Linux.

Concatenate these two files into a file3.

Hint: You may concatenate files by providing them as arguments to the command cat (for example: cat f1 f2 [...] > f3).

Write the output of the command wc file3 into file4 and the output of ls into file5.

Now concatenate those 5 files and copy the output here:

"""

Hello
Bye
Hello
Bye
 2  2 10 file3
file1
file2
file3
file4
file5
