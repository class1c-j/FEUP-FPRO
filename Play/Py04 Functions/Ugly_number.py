"""
Write a Python function ugly(n) to check whether a given positive number n is an ugly number. Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. To check if a number is ugly, divide the number by the prime factors 2, 3 or 5, if the number becomes 1 then it is an ugly number, otherwise it is not. For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7. By convention, 1 is also an ugly number.

    for the number n=6, the result is True
    for the number n=14, the result is False
