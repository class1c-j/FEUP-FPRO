"""
You're helping a teller decide how to give change. Write a Python script that given the price of the sale and the amount received by user input, then prints a string indicating how many notes of each amount they have to give as change. Consider that the largest note available is the 50â‚¬ note and that all prices and amounts received are multiples of 5 (no coins!).

The result should be a string with the number of notes of each amount, separated by a space: "#50 #20 #10 #5".

Hint: To help format the result, use type conversions to string.
