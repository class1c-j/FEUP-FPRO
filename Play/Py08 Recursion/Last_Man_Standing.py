"""
In a circle of people, represented by a list of integers alist, a game will take place. Counting will start at the beginning of the list, and after counting a certain number of people, specified by step, the person where the counting stopped is out of the game.

Write a Python function last_man_standing(alist, step) that returns the last person left on the circle.

Using global variables or cycles is forbidden.
Adapted from: Inspired by the Josephus problem
